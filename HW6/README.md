# A Partial Rubric

Here is a partial rubric for Questions 2-5 to help guide your decisions about what to include in your response:

## Question 2 (30 points)

Students will receive 26-30 points if
- their essay is clear, 
- they addressed the specified tasks (A, B and C above) in an easy-to-follow manner, 
- they didn't make serious grammar or spelling mistakes, and 
- they responded in at least 150 words. 

If some, but not all of those things are true, they will score 21-25 points.

## Question 3 (15 points)

This question requires:
- a. A statement as to whether a transformation is necessary, and justification for the choice. (3 points)
- b. An assessment of collinearity. (2 points)
- c. A statement about how predictors were chosen, specifically the model selection algorithm, and correct application of that algorithm (10 points)

In each part, award full credit for successful completion of the task, most of the credit for a reasonable effort with a minor problem, and meaningfully fewer points if a key step is completely missing.

## Question 4 (15 points)

This question requires:
- a. A clear presentation of the model with a short recap of the steps taken to produce it. (5 points)
- b. Summaries based on R^2^ and significance testing (5 points)
- c. Demonstration that the model passed assumption checks (5 points)

For each of the three parts, award 3 points for a reasonable effort, and 5 points for a reasonable effort that produces a correct and logical response.

## Question 5 (10 points)

Students receive 10 points on this question for a correct and logical response (if their answer differs from mine but is correct given their work in Questions 3 and 4, award full credit here), 9 points for a minor error (perhaps a spelling mistake), and 6-8 points out of ten for a reasonable effort but at least one substantial problem or a substantial grammar issue.
