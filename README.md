You will turn in your Assignments using the Canvas system at https://canvas.case.edu. The courseâ€™s primary listing is PQHS 431, but students in CRSP 431 and MPHP 431 should find the same information. The link to post your responses for each new Assignment will appear a day or two after the deadline for the preceding assignment has passed.

Each assignment will require you to analyze some data, and prepare a report using R Markdown. You will submit both your Markdown file, and an HTML, PDF or Word document built from that Markdown file.
