You will turn in your Assignments using the Canvas system at https://canvas.case.edu. The courseâ€™s primary listing is PQHS 431, but students in CRSP 431 and MPHP 431 should find the same information. The link to post your responses for Assignment 1 will be there by the first day of class. Subsequent assignments will appear after the deadline for the preceding assignment has passed.

Each assignment will require you to analyze some data, and prepare a report using R Markdown. You will submit both your Markdown file, and an HTML, PDF or Word document built from that Markdown file.
