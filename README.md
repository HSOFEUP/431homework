# 431homework

There are six main Homework Assignments for PQHS/CRSP/MPHP 431.

Once all six assignments are complete, you may find an error in grading that you would like Dr. Love to review. You would do this by filling out [this Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/v5zBIuGnrLkbiuXU2) before noon on 2017-12-13.

1. [Assignment 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/431-2017_assignment-1.md) was due Friday 2017-09-15 at noon. [View complete post-deadline materials](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/tree/master/HW1).

You will turn in your Assignments using the Canvas system at https://canvas.case.edu. The courseâ€™s primary listing is PQHS 431, but students in CRSP 431 and MPHP 431 should find the same information. The link to post your responses for each new Assignment will appear a day or two after the deadline for the preceding assignment has passed.

Each assignment will require you to analyze some data, and prepare a report using R Markdown. You will submit both your Markdown file, and an HTML, PDF or Word document built from that Markdown file. Our preference is HTML.

## What We'd Ideally See in a Homework Assignment Submission

1. Submit HTML and R Markdown, without zipping the files together.
2. Use complete sentences, and proper English grammar, syntax and spelling. To use R Studio's spell-checker, hit F7.
3. Avoid printing things we don't need to see (like data frames) to judge your work.
4. Place empty lines before and after each code chunk.
5. Name every chunk, with no characters other than letters, numbers and underscores. No repetition!
6. Use headings to indicate the question being solved. Then leave a blank line before continuing with text.
7. Avoid repeating Dr. Love's questions verbatim.
8. Use the approach laid out in the [YOURNAME-hw_template.Rmd](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/YOURNAME-hw_template.Rmd) file posted above.
9. Your life will be far happier if you use an R Project every time you open R to do work. Just start your R Studio session with File ... New Project or File ... Open Project, as appropriate. We recommend that you use a separate R project for each homework assignment.
