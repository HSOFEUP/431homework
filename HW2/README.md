**431 Assignment 2**

Assignment 2 Answer Sketches prepared by Dr. Love and the 431 staff are available in a password-protected [PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431homework/blob/master/HW2/431-sketch2-pw-2017.pdf). Download the file, even though GitHub cannot display the file (claiming it is invalid - it's not invalid, it's just password-protected.)

Still to come are:

- The R Markdown version of the sketch (expect this on 2017-09-26)
- Grades and the Grading Rubric (expect them on 2017-09-28) 
  + Once you've successfully opened the grades PDF file on your computer, use the HWID code you received in an email from Dr. Love to identify your scores on the Assignment.
  + If you have a complaint about your grade, [read Section 13.1 of the Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431syllabus/general-course-policies.html) first.
